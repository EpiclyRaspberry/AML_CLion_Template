# AML Clion Template
a mod template for those who wanna build aml mods using jetbrain's clion

# how to setup
1. create a repository using this template
2. clone the repository
3. open this repository in clion
4. close clion and run `setup_template.py` and follow the instructions (make sure you have python installed duh)

### note

you should  have a knowledge of using clion and have a functioning brain so you can solve the problems yourself without screaming at me
